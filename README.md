# Finance Data Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning to predict next-day stock price movement using historical data from the S&P 500. Stock data was collected using the `yfinance` API across multiple time intervals. A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model was trained using `scikit-learn` to classify whether a stock's price would increase or decrease the following day. This project was a self-directed learning experience in machine learning and Python-based data science.

## Features
- Automated collection of S&P 500 stock data using `yfinance`
- Multi-interval data aggregation for robust feature engineering
- Implementation of an LDA classification model using `scikit-learn`
- Data preprocessing and visualization for exploratory analysis
- Self-contained and reproducible Python scripts

## Technologies Used
- Python
- yfinance
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
